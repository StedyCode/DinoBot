# DinoBot
A simple bot for the chrome browser t-rex game!
It's really simply programmed python, feel free to change some of the cords!
using time and pyautogui!
1. To run put the code in a python IDE (I use pycharm)
2. Open chrome and turn of wifi
3. Split your screen so half is the chrome browser and half is the python IDE
4. Hit run and have fun! (cringe)
